abstract = {Parallel schemes in Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and in particular fine-grained or cellular Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) to tackle constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) have been narrowly investigated. Cellular GAs structural properties balance exploration and exploitation stages during the search to avoid stagnation and possible premature convergence. This article proposes cMOGA/D, a novel algorithmic approach that takes advantage of structural properties in cGAs in combination with core concepts of well established MOEA/D technique, such as, targeting multiob-jective problems via multiple subproblems by Tchebycheff decomposition ; its neighbouring conceptual basis; and also combining a CMOP Constraint Handling Technique (CHT) called push and pull search (PPS). A thorough empirical assessment shows an improved cMOGA/D performance in comparison to previous state of the art approaches.},

@article{Garcia-Garcia2022,
abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have had a remarkable performance in difficult computer vision tasks. In previous years, human experts have developed a number of specialized CNN archi-tectures to deal with complex image datasets. However, the automatic design of CNN through Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained importance to reduce and possibly avoid human expert intervention. One of the main challenges in NAS is to design less complex and yet highly precise CNNs when both objectives conflict. This study extends Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) for CNNs representation in NAS through multi-objective evolutionary optimization for image classification tasks. The proposed CGP-NAS algorithm is built on CGP by combining real-based solutions representation and the well-established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). A detailed empirical assessment shows CGP-NAS achieved competitive performance when compared to other state-of-the-art proposals while significantly reduced the evolved CNNs architecture's complexity as well as GPU-days.},

abstract = {We propose a novel neural architecture search (NAS) approach for the challenge of designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that achieve a good tradeoff between complexity and accuracy. We rely on Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) and integrated real-based and block-chained CNN representation, for optimization using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in the continuous domain. We introduce two variants, CGP-NASV1 and CGP-NASV2, which differ in the granularity of their respective search spaces. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we utilized the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,and SVHN datasets. Additionally, we extended the empirical analysis while maintaining the same solution representation to assess other searching techniques such as differential evolution (DE), the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and the S metric selection evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (SMS-EMOA). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits competitive classification performance and model complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.}
